# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

* To analyze how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

* Analyzed by creating a pivot table and line chart outlining campaign outcomes based on launch date.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* A difficulty that I encountered was a data discrepancy in the Outcomes based on Goals section due to fogetting the "equals to" part in the "greater/less than or equals to" part of some of the COUNTIFS functions.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  * May is the most successful month to launch a theater campaign, and December is the least successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  * Play campaigns with a goal of up to Â£4999 have the most success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  * Datasheet does not take in to account how long each campaign was up for.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  * Could possibly look at goal outcomes based in countires.
